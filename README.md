![student performance analysis cover 1](https://github.com/Jenniferonyebuchi/STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS/blob/main/student%20performance%20analysis%20cover%201.JPG)

### Introduction
---
This report provides an in-depth analysis of student performance, including demographic insights, academic trends, and high-performance patterns. The dataset comprises columns such as gender, parental education level, race/ethnicity, test preparation course, and scores in mathematics, reading, and writing.
The visualizations are created using Power BI, and this document outlines the key findings and potential use cases.

### Skills demonstrated for the project:
***
* Data Cleaning,
* Data Visualization,
* Quick Measure,
* Filters, Tooltips,
* Critical Thinking,
* Problem Solving.

### Problem Statement 
---
1.	Analyze student demographics to understand trends.
2.	Evaluate academic performance by gender, parental education, test preparation course and ethnicity.
3.	Identify high-performing students.
4.	Explore the impact of test preparation, parental education, etc  on scores.

### Data Source:
I obtained the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

### Data Columns
---
1.	Gender: Gender of the students.
2.	Race/Ethnicity: Ethnic group of the students.
3.	Parental Level of Education: Highest educational attainment of parents.
4.	Lunch: The lunch type the student was subscribed to
5.	Test Preparation Course: Whether a student completed a test preparation course.
6.	Math Score: Student's score in mathematics.
7.	Reading Score: Student's score in reading.
8.	Writing Score: Student's score in writing.

### Data Transformation
***
The dataset had no unique identifier, hence I had to create two new measures to show the student count and high performers.

#### Student Count

### ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
---
To ensure clarity, the Dashboard has four different pages of visuals:

* Student Count Analysis- This page provides insights into the total number of students, including their distribution based on gender, demographics, and other relevant categories.

* Average Scores Analysis - This page highlights the trends in average scores across subjects, parental level of education, etc, offering a comprehensive view of overall academic performance.

* High-Performance Analysis - This page focuses on top-performing students, identifying patterns, factors contributing to their success, and how they compare to overall student performance.
  
* Impact Tree- This page shows the impact of Gender, Test preparation course, Race/Ethnicity, and Parental Level of Education on Students Performance

* Students whose parents had high school or some high school scored below average whereas, those  whose parents attained some college education, a bachelor's degree, a master's degree, or an associate degree performed above average.
* The highest average scores were achieved by students whose parents held master's degrees, while the lowest averages were observed among students whose parents had high school education.

#### Average scores by Test Preparation Course
![image](https://github.com/Jenniferonyebuchi/STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS/blob/main/Average%20scores%20by%20test%20preparation%20course.JPG)

* The possibility of students from Group E who completed the test preparation course and whose parents had bachelor's degrees finishing as high performers is very high compared to any other category of students.

### Impact Tree
To gain deeper insights into the influence of gender, test preparation course completion, race/ethnicity, and parental level of education on student performance, I utilized a decomposition tree visualization. This approach effectively highlights the hierarchical relationships and relative impact of each factor on student outcomes.

![image](https://github.com/Jenniferonyebuchi/STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS/blob/main/Impact%20Decomposition%20Tree.JPG)
* Female students who completed the Test Preparation Course from Group E whose parents had a bachelor's degree education had higher chances of becoming high performers than any other category of students.

### Conclusions and Recommendations
---
* Students' performance correlates strongly with parental education level. There is a need to implement targeted academic support and mentorship programs for students whose parents have lower education levels.
* Students should be encouraged to participate in the test preparation course. Incentives could be offered to students from underperforming groups, such as Groups A and B. There's a need to leverage Parental Involvement
* The school should focus on Gender-Specific Interventions by providing tailored resources to bridge the gender gap in math for female students and reading/writing gaps for male students, ensuring balanced academic growth.
* Students who opted for standard lunch made up a significant majority (64.5%), potentially indicating a socioeconomic divide that could influence performance. Support should be provided for such students with Lower Socioeconomic Backgrounds.
* There's a need to engage with parents from  underperforming groups through workshops to raise awareness of how their educational background influences their children's performance and encourage their active involvement in academic support.
* The school should address disparities in performance across racial/ethnic groups by providing culturally tailored learning programs and resources to support students from Groups A, B, and C.
* There's a need to study the strategies and environments contributing to Group E's success and replicate them across other groups to boost overall performance.
* There's a need to develop a holistic student support framework that puts gender, parental education, socioeconomic background, and race/ethnicity into consideration to ensure equitable opportunities for all students.
